    <p>
        IMPORTANT — READ CAREFULLY: This license agreement (&quot;LICENSE&quot;) is a legal 
        agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity, also referred to 
        as &quot;LICENSEE&quot;, &quot;YOU&quot;) and NeuroSpeech, Inc., (&quot;NeuroSpeech&quot;), for the software 
        containing this LICENSE which may also include the software’s source code 
        written in a high–level computer language, associated media, printed materials, 
        and &quot;online&quot; or electronic documentation (collectively referred to as 
        &quot;SOFTWARE&quot;).</p>
    <p>
        Any earlier license we may have granted to you for the use of earlier versions 
        of the SOFTWARE is replaced by this LICENSE.</p>
    <h2>
        SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE</h2>
    <p>
        The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright 
        treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties and contains 
        confidential information and trade secrets. NeuroSpeech retains all rights not 
        expressly granted to you in this LICENSE.</p>
    <h2>
        I. GRANT OF LICENSE</h2>
    <p>
        NeuroSpeech hereby grants to you, and you accept, a non–exclusive, 
        non–transferable license to install, copy, use and modify the SOFTWARE only as 
        authorized below. You are granted: (1) a trial license pursuant to Section 1 
        below; and (2) either a Developer License with Subscription pursuant to Section 
        2 or a Developer License with Subscription and Source Code pursuant to Section 
        3. Which developer license applies (i.e., Developer License with Subscription or 
        Developer License with Subscription and Source Code) is determined at the time 
        of the license purchase.</p>
    <p>
        This license grants you no rights to the &quot;2007 Microsoft Office System User 
        Interface&quot;. For an appropriate license, please, contact Microsoft directly.</p>
    <h3>
        1. TRIAL LICENSE</h3>
    <p>
        You are granted a license for evaluation purposes only. You are authorized to 
        install, copy, and use the SOFTWARE for the sole purpose of testing its 
        functionality. You are not allowed to integrate it in end products or use it for 
        any commercial or productive purpose.</p>
    <h3>
        2. DEVELOPER LICENSE WITH SUBSCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>
        The SOFTWARE is licensed per Developer seat. This means that each individual 
        using or otherwise accessing the SOFTWARE for development purposes must obtain 
        the right to do so by purchasing an individual product license.</p>
    <p>
        You may make copies on more than one computer, as long as the use of the 
        SOFTWARE is by the same licensed developer. The SOFTWARE is in &quot;use&quot; on a 
        computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into 
        permanent memory (e.g. hard disk or other storage device) of that computer for 
        development purposes. If you install the SOFTWARE on a network server for the 
        sole purpose of internal distribution among licensed developers this is not 
        considered &quot;use&quot; of the SOFTWARE, so long as each individual developer has 
        purchased a license.</p>
    <p>
        In addition, you are eligible for a 1 Year Subscription to receive updates, if 
        any.</p>
    <h5>
        2–1. Redistribution rights:</h5>
    <p>
        You may distribute the SOFTWARE (or, where applicable, the run–time portion of 
        the SOFTWARE) provided that:</p>
    <p>
        · You distribute the SOFTWARE, in object code form only, as part of solutions 
        for internal company use, hosted applications, commercial solutions deployed at 
        end–users’ sites or shrink–wrapped software (PACKAGED PRODUCTS) in which the 
        SOFTWARE is integrated.</p>
    <p>
        · You ensure that the SOFTWARE is not distributed in any form that allows it to 
        be reused by any application other than your solution. Technical guidelines will 
        be provided upon request, contact support@neurospeech.com for more details.</p>
    <p>
        · You duly inform your customers that they are not allowed to use the SOFTWARE 
        independently from your solution. For use of the SOFTWARE in design–time (i.e. 
        within a development environment such as Microsoft Visual Studio) your customers 
        need to purchase the appropriate number of Developer Licenses from NeuroSpeech.</p>
    <p>
        · You include a valid copyright message in your solution in a location viewable 
        by the end–users (e.g. &quot;About&quot; box).</p>
    <p>
        · You assume full responsibility for your customer’s use of the SOFTWARE and 
        must ensure that NeuroSpeech has no obligation to such customer or liability for 
        such customer’s use of the SOFTWARE.</p>
    <p>
        All product licenses granted by you to your end user customers in accordance 
        with the terms of this agreement are perpetual and royalty–free.</p>
    <h5>
        2–2. Standard Support:</h5>
    <p>
        As part of your Developer License you are entitled to NeuroSpeech’s &quot;Standard&quot; 
        Support Package for a limited period of time, which guarantees an initial

    <h5>
        2–3. Subscription</h5>
    <p>
        You are entitled to receive all version updates for the SOFTWARE for a period of 
        1 (one) year. Further details regarding the Subscription benefits can be found

        proprietary trade secrets of NEUROSPEECH. All individuals employed by or 
        belonging to your entity agree to expend every effort to insure its 
        confidentiality. You agree to assume full responsibility for such employees’ or 
        contractors’ use, or misuse, of such disclosed source code as if it was your 
        use. These obligations shall not apply to any information generally available to 
        the public, independently developed or obtained without reliance on NEUROSPEECH 
        information, or approved in writing for release by NEUROSPEECH without 
        restriction.</p>
    <h2>
        II. LICENSE LIMITATIONS</h2>
    <p>
        · At no time may the SOFTWARE be used for development purposes by individuals 
        other than the licensed developer(s).</p>

    <h2>
        VII. LIMITED WARRANTY</h2>
    <p>

        accordance with the accompanying user documentation for a period of ninety (90) 
        days. NEUROSPEECH does not warrant that use of the SOFTWARE will be 
        uninterrupted or error free at all times and in all circumstances, nor that 
        program errors will be corrected. This limited warranty shall not apply to any

        follow operating instructions, (iii) negligence or accident, or (iv)

        the event of a breach of warranty, LICENSEE ‘s sole and exclusive remedy, is 
        repair of all or any portion of the SOFTWARE. If such remedy fails of its 
        essential purpose, LICENSEE ‘s sole remedy and NEUROSPEECH’s maximum liability 
        shall be a refund of the paid purchase price for the defective SOFTWARE only. 
        This limited warranty is only valid if NEUROSPEECH receives written notice of 
        breach of warranty no later than thirty (30) days after the warranty period 
        expires. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, 
        NEUROSPEECH DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING

        NEUROSPEECH’S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT 
        EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE SUM OF THE LICENSE FEES LICENSEE PAID TO NEUROSPEECH 
        FOR THE PRODUCT GIVING RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF 
        ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
        EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS 
        EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE. NEUROSPEECH IS NOT RESPONSIBLE 
        FOR ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF CONTENT PROVIDED BY LICENSEE OR A THIRD PARTY 
        THAT IS ACCESSED THROUGH THE PRODUCT AND/OR ANY MATERIAL LINKED THROUGH SUCH 
        CONTENT. ANY DATA INCLUDED IN A PRODUCT UPON SHIPMENT FROM NEUROSPEECH IS FOR
